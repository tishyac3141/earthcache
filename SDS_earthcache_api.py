This is the main class that someone would want to use for things like:
- directly creating a pipeline
- running a search
- creating a pipeline from a ran search
- downloading the images from a pipeline
- checking the status of a pipeline
- viewing the first image from the downloaded images 
- calculating the price of a pipeline
